# Travel Agency (React + TypeScript + Vite)
This mini static page project was mostly used for learning basic React and Typescript. <br>
I even used ```Snyk``` for the first time, mostly to see how it looks and feels, gotta say that I liked it but it probably had no point with a project this small but it was still fun learning about it.<br>
I'm gonna use it often in my future projects that's for sure.
